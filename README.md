Welcome to the Pathfinders app!
This readme should help explain how to build/run the project.

First you are going to want to make sure that you have the Android Studio desktop application installed. You can install it straight from their website for free.
Next, make sure that you have git installed in your machine. If you do not, you can install it straight frm their webiste for free as well. 
Once you have installed Android Studio and Git you should open a bash terminal or a command prompt and clone the project by cding into your preferred directory and typing git clone and then the entire url for this github repo.
This will save the project files to your device thus letting you open the project inside of Android Studio. 
Once you load the project in Andrid Studio (file > open > select the project) sync the gradle files by pressing the sync button in the top right have corner of the application. 
Once synced you can run the application! Happy Pathfinding!
